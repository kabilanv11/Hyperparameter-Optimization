# Hyperparameter Optimization using PSO and Genetic Algorithms
In this work we try to apply Meta
heuristic algorithms such as <b>Genetic Algorithm</b> and <b>Particle
Swarm Optimization</b> algorithm to find the optimum set of
hyper parameters for training a Neural Net model that can
give best results.
This work also compares the optimization algorithms with
various factors like <i>computation time, time to convergence</i> and
tries to find the best one.
